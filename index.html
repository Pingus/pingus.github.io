<h2>What is Pingus?</h2>
<p>Pingus is a free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings">Lemmings<sup>tm</sup></a>-like puzzle game covered under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>. It features currently 77 playable levels and runs under a wide variety of operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOSX, etc.)</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>Pingus has started at the end of 1998 with the simple goal to create a Free (as in freedom, not as in free beer) Lemmings<sup>tm</sup> clone. The <em>Free</em> means you get the sources and are allowed and encouraged to change and distribute them. You basically get everything that I used to create this game. In the years it has grown than quite a bit over the original goal and become something more than just a clone, we have original artwork, a built-in level editor, new actions, multiplayer and a few other features.</p>
<p>If you don't know Lemmings<sup>tm</sup>, here comes a short introduction. It is a puzzle game developed in 1991 by <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/company/sheet/companyId,146/">DMA Design</a>. The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals and has to guide them through levels. Since the animals walk on their own, the player can only influence them by giving them commands, like <em>build a bridge</em>, <em>dig a hole</em> or <em>redirect all animals in the other direction</em>. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for this multiple combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view. For more information you might want to visit one of the numerous visit <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110718120402/http://www.deveria.com/alexis/lemmings/fanlinks.html">Lemmings<sup>tm</sup> fanpages</a> on the net.</p>
<p>While Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings<sup>tm</sup>, it however doesn't try to be an exact clone, it has included a few ideas of its own, like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. It has also a few new actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game. To get an impression of the look of the Pingus game you might want to have a look at some <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>.</p>
